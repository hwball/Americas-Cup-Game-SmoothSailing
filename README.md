# SENG302 Project

This project was completed eight second professional year software engineering students from the University of Canterbury.

This game was built on top of a [America's cup data viewer](https://github.com/hwball/Americas-Cup-Data-viewer--RaceVision) by the same students.
It supports multiplay via tcp connections although local firewalls may prevent this.
